    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the history of the NBA and basketball, there have been five positions: pg, sg, sf, pf, and center. A lot has changed during the past few years. Players are adopting new and different styles of plays, transcending their predefined roles. For example, centers, who traditionally spend most of their time in the paint, protecting the rim, and dunking on people, are now making plays away from the basket and moving towards mid range shots and even three-pointers. The dynamic evolution of basketball requires a more accurate and robust categorization of players. This may help teams better understand their lineups, and know which type of players they are missing or have an overabundance of. Knowledge like this can help teams make more informed decisions in building a strong team. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How are we going to do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we are going to use the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize NBA players into distinct groups based on their playstyles and on-court tendencies. K-means is an unsupervised machine learning technique that partitions data points into clusters, where each cluster represents a group of players with similar characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by selecting a predefined number of clusters (K). The algorithm then iteratively assigns each player to the cluster whose centroid (representative point) is closest to their statistical profile. This proximity is determined using a distance metric, often Euclidean distance. The centroids are re-calculated based on the players assigned to each cluster in each iteration, optimizing cluster separation. The process continues until convergence is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means provides a data-driven approach to player categorization, allowing us to uncover patterns in player performance beyond traditional positional boundaries. By identifying inherent similarities and differences among players, we aim to reveal meaningful insights into the evolving landscape of NBA basketball.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Points\n",
    "- Assists\n",
    "- Rebounds\n",
    "- Steals\n",
    "- Blocks\n",
    "- % of 2-point goals assisted\n",
    "- % of 3-point goals assisted\n",
    "- % of goals made close to the basket (denoted as layup %)\n",
    "- % of goals made as mid-range shots\n",
    "- % of goals made as  three-pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "$*$ all statistics are in per 36 mins of play to adjust for playing time differences\n",
    "Above are the features which we will use in K-means clustering. Each statistic provides vital insights into the player's unique style and role on the court. For instance, a player with high rebound and block numbers may be classified as a dominant big man. Conversely, a player with a lower points-to-assists ratio may typify a pass-first point guard, prioritizing setting up teammates over scoring. Another player with high three-point field goal attempts, steals, and blocks could fit the profile of a 'three-and-D' player, renowned for their perimeter shooting and defensive contributions. Moreover, there may be combinations of stat lines that reveal entirely novel player archetypes, ones yet to be categorized or named.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Processing \n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we are only going to use players who have played more than 25 games and at least 12 minutes a game, because it is hard to determine the playstyle of an individual when they barely play or when they only play “garbage” minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the statistic, % of goals that are three-pointers, a number of plays are missing this stat because they have never shot a three-pointer throughtout the season. In our case, they are all centers. We replaced the NA values for those players with the median, which is 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Players who played on multiple teams during the season, have multiple rows. One represents their average stats across teams, and the others detail team-specific stats. We are going to use the former, since a player’s style of play usually does not change drastically when they play on different teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "All features are scaled or standardized to have a mean of 0 and 1. Scaling does not change the fundamental information contained in the data, or the relationship between data points. It ensures that variables with larger units are not given higher importance solely due to their measurement scales.\n"

    "\n",
    "To determine the right number of clusters, we initially applied the elbow method, a widely used technique to identify the point where the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) starts to level off. The number on the “elbow” appears to be 3. However, when we used that number for K-means, the results were unsatisfactory, with players with drastically different playstyles within the same cluster. As a response, we experimented with multiple cluster counts, and using domain knowledge, we decided on 8. Our goal was to strike a balance between creating granular clusters that capture nuanced player variations and avoiding over-segmentation that might lead to less interpretable results.\n"
